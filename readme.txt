---WELCOME TO THE SANDBOX---

Hello there! This is the sandbox repository. I can use this space to practice and make little 
hobby projects while I learn how to become a web developer. 

Everything in this repository should be considered temporary and not terribly important. Files, and even entire projects,
may be scrapped when I feel that I no longer need them, or when I want to start doing something else. However,
if I just happen to make something I'm actually proud of, I'm sure I'll find a way to move it somewhere
a little more permanent.

---THE SANDBOX WIKI---

The Sandbox Wiki is the current project here on the Sandbox repository. It's a collection
of silly, irrelevant or useless, loosely categorized articles, for the purpose of practicing
good folder structure and naming conventions. It also serves as a platform for my classmates
to practice using Git!

[General Rules & Guidelines]
Keep it reasonably child-friendly. Don't add articles or images with any explicit material. This Wiki is 
just for practicing and having a laugh, not to post your edgy Warhammer 40k fanfics. 

Oh, and don't feed Larry. 

Please.

[Naming Convention]
The naming convention, for all files, should be as consistent and clear as possible. Since the
entire wiki is organized in a hierarchy, the name for each file should be simple enough to 
figure out. First, specify the file type, such as: 
    - image_ 
    - article_
    - template_
    - category_

(NOTE: At the time of writing, I haven't set this up properly! I'll get to it soon, so that new collaborators 
can easily join in without getting confused.)

[Wiki Contents & Structure]
Currently, the Wiki has five categories: Memes, Animals, Veggies, Dinosaurs and Arcana.
As the project expands, these categories may be expanded upon, or new categories could be added.
Each category also has sub-categories, which can be added by anyone at any time if the existing
sub-categories don't fit the article you want to make! Each article template is made to be flexible
enough that it fits to any sub-category within the main category. 

When adding new sub-categories, please make sure the style is consistent with the already existing ones.
For example, if one category is displayed with a <h2> tag, don't make a new one with an <h3> tag or
something else like that. Keep it consistent!
