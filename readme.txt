-----WELCOME TO THE SANDBOX-----

Hello there! This is the sandbox repository. I can use this space to practice and make little 
hobby projects while I learn how to become a web developer. 

Everything in this repository should be considered temporary and not terribly important. Files, and even entire projects,
may be scrapped when I feel that I no longer need them, or when I want to start doing something else. However,
if I just happen to make something I'm actually proud of, I'm sure I'll find a way to move it somewhere
a little more permanent.

-----HOW TO USE THE SANDBOX WIKI-----

The Sandbox Wiki is the current project here on the Sandbox repository. It's a collection
of silly, irrelevant or useless, loosely categorized articles, for the purpose of practicing
good folder structure and naming conventions. It also serves as a platform for my classmates
to practice using Git!

[General Rules & Guidelines]
Keep it reasonably child-friendly. Don't add articles or images with any explicit material. This Wiki is 
just for practicing and having a laugh, not to post your edgy Warhammer 40k fanfics. 

Oh, and don't feed Larry. 

Please.

[Wiki Contents & Structure]
Currently, the Wiki has five categories: Memes, Animals, Veggies, Dinosaurs and Arcana.
As the project expands, these categories may be expanded upon, or new categories could be added.
Each category also has sub-categories, which can be added by anyone at any time if the existing
sub-categories don't fit the article you want to make! Each article template is made to be flexible
enough that it fits to any sub-category within the main category. 

When adding new sub-categories, please make sure the style is consistent with the already existing ones.
For example, if one category is displayed with a <h2> tag, don't make a new one with an <h3> tag or
something else like that. Keep it consistent! 

[Naming Convention]
The naming convention, for all files, should be as consistent and clear as possible. Since the
entire wiki is organized in a hierarchy, the name for each file should be simple enough to 
figure out. Here are some examples of how to name a file. First, specify the file type: 
    - img_ 
    - article_
    - template_
    - category_

then, the category:
    - _animals
    - _arcana
    - _dinosaurs
    - _memes
    - _veggies

followed by the sub-category:
    - _ratpack
    - _artifacts
    - _tubers
    - _frogmemes

and lastly, the name and the proper file extension:
    - _larry.html
    - _spellbook.jpg
    - _notes.txt

Sticking to this naming convention makes it MUCH easier to write in the correct links and adding the new files 
with Git when you're ready to upload, so make sure you get it right and check your spelling! If you're unsure,
ask JStameus, the Wiki owner, for help. 

[Creating New Articles]
When creating a new article, make sure you create the html file in the correct folder, with the correct name.
Then, to make it easier to keep the wiki clean, use an article template for your article, instead of 
writing the whole thing from scratch! For example, if you want to create a new vegetable, copy all the code 
from template_article_veggies.html into your new file, and use it as a baseline. You can of course create your 
own tags and add things, if you want!

[Viewing The Wiki]
As we haven't learned how to upload our websites yet, the Wiki can only be viewed locally. So, if you want
to get the latest updates and articles, remember to keep your local copy of the Wiki up to date by pulling
from the master branch of the original repository whenever you can. If you haven't already, install the Live 
Server extension for Visual Studio Code, so you can view the local copy of the Wiki as if it were a real 
website! It's neat!
