-----WELCOME TO THE SANDBOX-----

Hello there! This is the sandbox repository. I can use this space to practice and make little 
hobby projects while I learn how to become a web developer. 

Everything in this repository should be considered temporary and not terribly important. Files, and even entire projects,
may be scrapped when I feel that I no longer need them, or when I want to start doing something else. However,
if I just happen to make something I'm actually proud of, I'm sure I'll find a way to move it somewhere
a little more permanent.

---JSON PRACTICE: LOOT TABLES---

I'm learning how to use JSON files. For this little project, I'll try using JSON files to store data about
"loot tables" and their contents, and use them with some JavaScript code and CSS to display a random list
of items with unique properties depending on which loot table I'm rolling.
