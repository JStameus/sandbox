-----WELCOME TO THE SANDBOX-----

Hello there! This is the sandbox repository. I can use this space to practice and make little 
hobby projects while I learn how to become a web developer. 

Everything in this repository should be considered temporary and not terribly important. Files, and even entire projects,
may be scrapped when I feel that I no longer need them, or when I want to start doing something else. However,
if I just happen to make something I'm actually proud of, I'm sure I'll find a way to move it somewhere
a little more permanent.

---CSS PRACTICE---

Currently working on a webpage to try out some neat CSS stuff, hopefully it'll
feel "alive" and interactive even without any JavaScript. I have no idea what the 
end result will be. I'm just goofing around at the moment.
