//border-radius
What does this do? It looks like it's creating another border?

//figures
What's a quick way to make figures appear on the same line?

//figcaptions
How to I make my text fit inside a specified area so that it doesn't 
move that citation at the bottom of the card? 

//display: inline-block
My cards are now next to each other, but the green one is slightly lower?
Why is this happening? EDIT: Adding more text to the caption "fixed" it. What?

//general
I'm getting a lot of different selectors in my stylesheet now. How do I clean this up?
Do I create different css files for different things?

//HTML editor
Is there a way to quickly generate elements with preset attributes?
For example, I'm creating a lot of figures with similar contents, including
images with the same preset height and width. Can I save these settings
and quickly generate these figures instead of doing it manually?

//box color/vignette
I created a sweet vignette effect in the body, but it has clearly visible edges. 
How do I apply an effect to the entire window? EDIT: By putting it in :root. But 
something tells me that it's nasty to put stuff there. Should I put it elsewhere?

//transform translate
How does it work?

//z-index
Sets a "layer" for an element so they can overlap. Neat!

//Menus
Menus/Navigation can be made with ul, then hide the bullets and put the elements 
on the same line with CSS.

//Sections, Articles & Divs
Sections and articles REQUIRE a heading(h1, h2 etc). If you have a "section" that doesn't
have a heading, use div instead. It's possible to use section without a heading, but it won't
validate. Remember: It's OK to use divs right in main, you don't have to use semantic elements
at the top. Just make sure to give your higher-level divs a proper id and it's all gucci!

//Git 
Instead of writing --all when staging files, use *. You can also put file extensions(or anything, really)
after *, to include ALL files that end with what you put it. For example, "git add *.html" will add
all files that end with .html. You can also do this the other way around, such as "git add IMG_*" to 
add all files that begin with IMG_.
