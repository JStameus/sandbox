            Mildred is a cozy rat who likes to eat popcorn, crackers and bugs. Her favorite
            pastimes include making poop tunnels and watching humans kick 
            balls into nets on television. She doesn't understand the intricacies of 
            human society, but that's alright. She suspects they don't, either.
