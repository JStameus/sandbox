            Nobody knows where Larry is from, or when he was born. Everything 
            surrounding his past is a total enigma. It is rumored that his birth
            certificate is locked up and classified in the Pentagon. When he isn't busy
            sifting through trash to look for Walmart coupons, he is usually holed
            up in his lair right next to a run-down pizzeria.
