        <h1>Category: Forbidden Arcana</h1>
        <p> Don't let the title fool you, the Forbidden Arcana section is only slightly less
            forbidden than putting pineapple on pizza. Here, you'll find all manner of things 
            related to magic, such as spells, enchanted computer mice, foul-smelling health potions,
            and those weird dust bunnies that seem to grow legs are being neglected for too long.
