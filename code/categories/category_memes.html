        <h1>Category: Funny Memes</h1>
        <p>The internet is for memes. Deep down, we all know this to be true. We hate to
            admit it, but even though we try to keep a solid poker face when someone scurries 
            up to you, holding up a phone with a picture of a cartoon squirrel, a part of us
            is wheezing with laughter. Ok, maybe not. But still, it felt wrong not to include
            this category.
