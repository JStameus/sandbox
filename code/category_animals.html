        <h1>Category: Cute Animals</h1>
        <p>There are many kinds of animals in the world. To date, over 14 different kinds have been found! 
            Most of them are precious, and should not, under any circumstance, be violently murdered. Animals
            are friends, and we must protect them at all costs. However, in the unlikely event that
            an animal is trying to eat you, it's a good idea to run away and call my grandma, as she is 
            pretty good at handling that sort of thing.
