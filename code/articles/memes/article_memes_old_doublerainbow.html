            Double Rainbow(All the way(across the sky!)) is an old and crusty meme born in the early period of viral nonsense, featuring a cool dude, probably stone off his gourd, shouting at the sky and crying about a double rainbow in Yosemite Park. While the meme itself had no real comedic value and was quickly done to death by a plethora of music remixes, the man behind it is himself quite rad and the author of this article vibes with him a lot.
